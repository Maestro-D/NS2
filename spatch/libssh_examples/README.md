# `libssh` examples

## What is this?
This document aims to explain how to compile and use the `libssh` client and
server examples available in this directory

## How to compile?
### Requirements
- You need to have `libssh` installed on your system
- Tested on Linux with `gcc`

### Sample ssh client
```
$ cd sample_ssh_client
$ make
```
- Executable file is `sample_ssh_client`

### Sample ssh server
```
$ cd sample_ssh_server
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make VERBOSE=1
```
- Executable file is `sample_sshd`

## How to use?
### Requirements
- You need to have `openssh` installed on your system

### Sample ssh client
#### Run a classic ssh server
For my tests I commented almost everything in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, what remains
in the file is
```sh
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

AuthorizedKeysFile	.ssh/authorized_keys
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
UsePAM yes
```

Then launch the server
```
$ sudo systemctl start sshd.socket # or sshd.service
$ sudo systemctl status sshd.socket # or sshd.service
‚óè sshd.socket
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.socket; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)

   Listen: [::]:22 (Stream)

```

#### Run sample client
```
$ cd sample_ssh_client
$ ./sample_ssh_client

ssh_options_set() success!

Password:
```
- The client should automatically connects with the server
- The server should take the default local account as default username
- Type you password
- The client should print the result of an `ls` command in your Shell

### Sample ssh server
#### Run sample server
```
$ ./generate_host_keys.bash
$ cd sample_ssh_server/build
$ ./sample_sshd -v -r ../../host_keys/ssh_host_rsa_key -d ../../host_keys/ssh_host_dsa_key -p 42010 localhost
Started sample libssh sshd on port 42010
You can login as the user libssh with the password libssh

```

#### Connect classic ssh client to server
At the same time in another console

```
$ ssh libssh@localhost -p 42010

- Press `ENTER` each time some input is prompted
- Except for `libssh@localhost's password: ` type `libssh`
- After that you enter in an echo mode with server
- You can exit via `^D` or `^C`

*Note: You need to be quick while entering the needed input or the server might
close the connection*
